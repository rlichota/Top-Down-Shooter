A simple game written using Qt. Following a tutorial by Abdullah Aghazadah found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lqhMLFHj3A&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn.

Editing and running this game right now requires Qt, which can be found at https://www.qt.io. It is unknown why the game is not loading, but an answer will be posted here once discovered.
